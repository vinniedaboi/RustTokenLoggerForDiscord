# RustTokenLoggerForDiscord
This is a rust token logger for discord using basic client server protocol and regex.

## WINDOWS ONLY (both server and client also take into count that it only works for people with the discord app)

**Step 1**

Change the ip to your ip and port to whatever port you desire.

**Step 2**

```
python3 server.py
```

**Step 3**
```
./whateverthecompiledfileis
```

## THIS IS PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ANY MALICIOUS USE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME

**I will be adding chrome support in the future also with other browsers**
